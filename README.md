# puzzle-solver
Solves various different types of puzzles using the wave function collapse algorithm + recursion

 * puzzles that are currently implemented work, but input sucks
 * jigsaw sudoku may be added in the near future, otherwise july 2022 or so
 * implimentations for input gui will start min end of july 2022
 * after that the sidebar on the left will also be implemented with buttons for:
   - generating an image of the current board state
   - generating an easily shareable code that uniquely identifies the puzzle type and board state
   - loading such a code into the program
   - settings (?)
 * loading "Test" will give you a preview of the user experience for the gui
